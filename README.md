## Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 16.04:

Step 1 — Installing Docker

The Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu 16.04 repository may not be the latest version. To get this latest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository. This section shows you how to do just that.

First, in order to ensure the downloads are valid, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

    sudo apt-get update

Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:

    apt-cache policy docker-ce

You should see output similar to the follow:
Output of apt-cache policy docker-ce
```
docker-ce:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu
  Version table:
     18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages
```

Notice that docker-ce is not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial).

Finally, install Docker:
```
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```

Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that it's running:
```
    sudo systemctl status docker
```
The output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:

Output
```
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-10-18 20:28:23 UTC; 35s ago
     Docs: https://docs.docker.com
 Main PID: 13412 (dockerd)
   CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
           ├─13412 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd://
           └─13421 docker-containerd --config /var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.toml
```
Installing Docker now gives you not just the Docker service (daemon) but also the docker command line utility, or the Docker client. We'll explore how to use the docker command later in this tutorial.
